# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 12, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on Checkio.org and Leetcode.com

**Thoughts** I started coding in a Data Science Bootcamp and learnt so much about machine learning and so on. Now I want to become fluent in Python. So I start with some bascis. 

**Links to work**
1. [Find the Child Who Has the Ball](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-child-who-has-the-ball-after-k-seconds/)
2. [Duplicate all Zeros in a List](https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/duplicate-zeros/)
3. [Non-unique Elements - Trim an array down to its non-unique elements](https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/non-unique-elements/)
4. [Even the Last - how to work with array indexes](https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/even-last/)

### Day 2: June 13, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through some exercises on Checkio.org

**Thoughts** Today it was a lot about how to handle strings and datetime format.

**Links to work**
1. [Extract first word - regardless of ., or '](https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/first-word/)
2. [Three words - check string for three consecutive words](https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/three-words/)
3. [Days difference - handle date format](https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/days-diff/)

### Day 3: June 14, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through an exercises on Checkio.org

**Thoughts** Today it was hard for me to figure out the errors in my code but in the end it worked. 

**Links to work**
[Changing directions - in a sequence of integers](https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/changing-direction/)

### Day 4: June 17, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through some exercises on Checkio.org and discovered the in-built function sorted()

**Thoughts** I worked again on handling strings and applying those methods. As well I was using a lambda function to access different dictionaries in a list, so I reached the next level of complexity of the tasks! That makes me very proud. 

**Links to work**
[Backward each word of a string without changing the order](https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/backward-each-word/)
[Find the most expensive products in a list of products - a list of dictionnaries](https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/bigger-price/)

### Day 5: June 18, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I delved into the built-in function str.find() and some others. 

**Thoughts** Sometimes I underestimate the power of knowing the built-in functions. So today I learnt a new one and had a look into the general overview. Sometimes, I realize that I am trying to code something from scratch and end up that there is a function for it that I just did not know.

### Day 6: June 19, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: This day was special as I was participating in a Data Scientist coding challenge.

**Thoughts** I was a bit nervous, about what to expect but in the end, it was a mix of coding and quizzes. So I had to write a Jupyter notebook and coded a lot for EDA and also modelling (Linear Regression). But unfortunately, I am not allowed to share more details or the code.

### Day 7: June 20, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Titanic - Going again into **Logistic Regression**.

**Thoughts** I want to refresh my modelling skills, so I decided to go into the **machine learning basics** and started today with EDA and Logistic Regression for the Titanic dataset.

### Day 8: June 21, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: **Building Generative AI Apps with Azure OpenAI Services**

**Thoughts** I am so glad that I found this event. Workshops are valuable possibilities for me to get in touch with important programmes and APIs. So I started today with this Microsoft Virtual Training Day to get an introduction into **Microsoft Azure OpenAI Services** and **use it to integrate a GenAI App** into any application or web service.
What I learnt:
- What do I need for a responsible AI?
- Use cases for GenAI
- Introduction into Azure OpenAI Studio
- Integration of REST APIs in Python and Shell
- Tuning parameters for Completion and ChatCompletion like Temperatur, max_token or defining the system role and giving few-shot-examples
- Prompt Engineering e.g. by step by step output, sharpen prompts with examples and precise roles to get the output I want
